1. Performance Optimization - Profiling and tuning the apps
2. Security enhancements - secure properties
3. Error Handling and Logging - make sure all the APIs follow the same error response patterns, for logging make sure sensitive data is being masked
4. Unit test cases and automated code review during development by making use of plugins for eclipse or IntelliJ
5. Code refactoring or cleanup - keeping in mind of JDK upgrade, if it comes to; externalise the properties (like leverage spring cloud for spring boot based apps), make room for new features of JDK which can reduce the lines of code.
6. Scalability - Make the java apps more cloud native
7. Documentation & User guides
8. If applicable, multilingual support can be considered
9. Accessiblity -  Ensure the app meets accessibility standards (WCAG) to improve user engagement
10. Real-time features - Notifications or live updates to stakeholders
11. Cloud integration
12. Performance metrics
13. Compliance with regulations
